# This script will configure rtibackup.pl to run seperate, full backups for each day of the week on the same backup device.
# Note: This script trusts your device is big enough for 7, seperate, 50GB partitions on your backup device, and that 50GB is large enough for your backup.
# Note2: There will be seven partions on the backup device. The number of the partition corrisponds to the day of the week + 4. Example: Mon = /dev/sdX5; Tues = /dev/sdX6; etc.
# Note3: Usage: if the script determines the incremental backup change has already been made to backups.config, it will prompt you asking if you want to format the device only.
